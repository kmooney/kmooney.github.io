<i class="my_face">Kevin</i> 
Howdy, I'm Kevin!  I am a software nerd living and working in Austin, TX.  I do Django and Python by day, everything else by night!  Creative integration is my favorite thing.  I think that exposing creative people to cool technology is awesome, because it causes rad things to get made, instead of making just another way to click an ad.   

:x!
