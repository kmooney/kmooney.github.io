So this is probably the 4th or 5th iteration of the site.  For a while it was a custom rig running Django, then a Wordpress, then a Tumblr.  Now I'm using Jekyll.  My old Wordpress posts (probably the best posts) are probably gone forever, but it's OK!  I only had some processing workbooks posted, and they all needed the Java plug-in anyways.  They'd be all but unviewable in 2013, the age of Java security updates.

I'm not finished with the infrastructure yet, so if I had an adorable little guy with a jackhammer or something, I would fersure put a little under construction guy in there.  Oh wait.  Here you go:

In the meantime here are the technical details about what's up and running and where we're hosting and all that jazz.

- Using Jekyll to generate static pages.  This is actually pretty fun!
- This is hosted on github, they provide free static file hosting, and directly integrate to Jekyll.  It is rad.
- Edited with Vim, none of that sublime-text jazz ya'll.
- Markup in Markdown.  Jekyll seems to prefer the [redcarpet](https://github.com/blog/832-rolling-out-the-redcarpet), so that's what we use!

There really is no back-end for this site.  For now, the front end is pretty much just some of the following:

- HTML
- [google fonts](http://google.com/fonts)
- and the excellent [pllrs](http://www.pllrs.com) to make it work on your phone.

My plan for this site is to highlight technical projects and just get some thoughts about what the heck I've learned making software for 10 dang years down in writing.  

The first thing I wanna do is hook up a comment system.  Since this page is hosted on github, and it's all static, the comments will be served from elsewhere.  I could use a rad tool like Disqus, but I would rather have fodder for a new post.  You can also go ahead and click over to the [projects](/projects.html) section to get a look at some of the stuff I'm doing, or just check out my [github page](http://github.com/kmooney/).

Thanks for reading.

:x!
