Here I am, a guy with a statically generated blog, trying to add comments.  I've already added a contact page that just goes to google docs, though you wouldn't know it's google docs just to look.

Now, I need to figure out how to get comments up and running on this site.  I'm thinking that what I will do is run a tornado server elsewhere, then make a teeny js client that will live at the bottom of each blog page to show comments.  I can turn comments on or off by editing my [Jekyll front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

I'm also going to hook in jade for the comments layouts.  Hopefully, I can get it going for the JS client.  Actually, it would be even better to deliver the JS code itself from chat.kevn.co -- where the websocket server will also live.

This should be interesting.

Thanks for reading!
