The last couple weeks have been spent working out some of the details in the very-sketchily-detailed last post, where I shared with the planet my decision to implement a Tetris-like game with microservices.
Since I've started working on this project, I have experienced both heady excitement and the deepest depths of regret for taking it on.
On the other hand, it will give me quite a lot to write about.

Since I have started, I have completed the Gameboard (though I wrote it in Go, not Ruby), a protocol guide, which I have regularly diverged from, and I have discovered some 1990s era technologies that would have been really useful had I not turned my nose up at them earlier in my career.
Thus far, I believe I have wished for the following technologies from the 90's:  [CORBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture) (or even COM would suffice), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), and especially the [W3C XML schema format] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_%28W3C%29) - I will get to my reasoning a bit later, along with a few ideas about how to get some of the same functionality in the stack I have chosen.
