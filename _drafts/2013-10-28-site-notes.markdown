So this is probably the 4th or 5th iteration of the site.  For a while it was a custom rig running Django, then a Wordpress, then a Tumblr.  Now I'm using Jeckyll.  My original Wordpress posts (probably the best posts) are probably gone forever, but it's OK!  I only had some processing workbooks posted, and they all needed the Java plug-in anyways.  They'd be all but unviewable now.

My plan for this blog is to post pretty much on the regular.  If I had an adorable little guy with a jackhammer or something, I would for sure put a little under construction guy in there.  Oh wait.  Here you go:  ![Under Construction!](/img/under_construction.gif)

In the meantime here are the technical details about what's up and running and where we're hosting and all that jazz.

* Using Jekyll to generate static pages.  This is actually pretty fun!
* Edited with Vim, none of that sublime-text jazz ya'll.
* Markup in Markdown.  Jekyll seems to prefer the [redcarpet](https://github.com/blog/832-rolling-out-the-redcarpet) 

My plan for this site is to highlight technical projects and just get some thoughts about what the heck I've learned making software for 10 dang years down in writing.  

The first thing I wanna do is hook up a comment system.  Since this page is hosted on github, and it's all static, the comments will be served from elsewhere.  I could use a rad tool like Disqus, but I would rather have fodder for a new post.  You can also go ahead and click over to the [projects](/projects.html) section to get a look at some of the stuff I'm doing, or just check out my [github page](http://github.com/kmooney/).

Thanks for reading.:w!
